<p>(Napa, Ca) Uvavita, a line of innovative skin care products, has entered the market with products that make use of grape seed oils and extracts, harvested from the Coppola&#8217;s successful local winery. The name is derived from the Latin words “Uva” for seed, and “Vita” for life, together meaning “The seed of life.” The grape seeds in Uvavita products tap into the anti-aging potential of grape seeds’ polyphenols. Founded three years ago, Uvavita was developed and nourished by Roman Coppola and his four friends who are dedicated to making a difference in the skin care world. <br><br>Roman grew up in California’s Napa Valley, where his father, Francis Ford Coppola, a famous film maker for films such as “The Godfather” series, owns a vineyard that produces a very successful line of wines. It was here where the idea sparked for Uvavita. “Grape seeds are a by-product of wine production and normally go unused. We are proud to have discovered a valuable benefit in something that is usually considered a waste product.” Coppola describes. He further accentuates the brand’s commitment to purity and sustainability by stating, “We use a wine permeate instead of harsh solvents to extract the phenols – it’s a pure, handmade way of extracting them. We’re coming at this from a wine-making tradition and from the place that is known for the finest grapes in the country.” <br><br>Uvavita’s product lineup consists of five distinct options:<br><br>1. Day Moisturizing Cream<br>2. Night Nourishing Cream<br>3. Exfoliating Dead Sea Mud Mask<br>4. Gentle Foaming Face Cleanser<br>5. Hydrating Body Lotion<br><br>The prices for these products range from between $28 &#8211; $56. Uvavita aims to produce quality<br>products that are accessible to a wide range of consumers. <br><br>Despite the business being under a year old, Uvavita has already broken into the forefront of 25 specialty stores, including Sephora. Business is going so well, Coppola plans to expand the distribution of the product up to 80 stores by the end of this year. In effect, making the reach of their products over three times what it already is.<br><br>Stephen Bock, Sephora’s Director of Merchandising, recently made comments on the popularity of grape seed extract-based products, expressing, “Grape Seed extract-based products are on fire right now in terms of sales.”<br><br>For more information about Uvavita and their new line of products, which are also sold on their website, please visit www.uvavita.com</p>
